 /*Hi, here are my notes for you about everything we talked about for the game
  * The player already has a script on them for enabling the knife, and the knife has a script started with notes on stabbing and checking for other players
  * we still need to do multiplayer, a timer for how long each person has the knife, actual stabbing, death, a way to restart the game(winning and losing)
  * also, something to decide who starts with the knife
  * 
  * I'm sure there are other things, so if you think of them, add them. I should be here 9am on Sunday to help with any of this*/
